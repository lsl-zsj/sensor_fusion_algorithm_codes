This repository contains the following folders and script.
- SFA: open MATLAB function of each sensor fusion algorithm;
- Optimization codes: function to compute the absolute orientation errors for each unit. The orientation is computed with all the combination of parameters given as input;
- function_utilities: includes some MATLAB functions helpful for the algorithms.
